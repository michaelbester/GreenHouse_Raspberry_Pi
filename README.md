## General Notes
I developed the greenhouse control software in python.  I wanted to learn a bit of python and decided to update my existing (ESP32) greenhouse controller hardware.
I had an unused raspberry pi in my office that I wanted to put to use, so I created my own raspberry pi "hat".
I used Qt for the GUI interface.  The software retrieves the outside weather using data from the internet.
The indoor temperature is read from a sensor attached to the pcb.
I used PYCHARM IDE for the software development.
